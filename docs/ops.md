### Image model switch (Vercel)

`GOOGLE_IMAGE_MODEL` and `OPENAI_IMAGE_MODEL` are optional. While both are absent (or empty or
whitespace) production uses the defaults chosen on 2026-10-04: Google
`gemini-3.1-flash-lite-image` through `models.generateContent`, OpenAI `gpt-image-2.5-flare`
through `images.generate` with `size 1024x1024`, `quality medium` and `background transparent`.

- Before any change, write down the current values and whether each of `AI_PROVIDER`,
  `GOOGLE_IMAGE_MODEL`, `IMAGEN_MODEL` and `OPENAI_IMAGE_MODEL` is present (no secrets).
- Switch: set the variable in the Vercel project environment (Production and/or Preview) and redeploy.
  No code release is needed. Only the variables of the active provider are read.
- Model EOL to plan against: `imagen-4.0-*` was retired by Google on 2026-08-17, `gpt-image-1.5` is
  retired by OpenAI on 2026-12-01. The two current defaults have no announced shutdown date.
- Verify the value against the grammar before saving, otherwise generation fails with a configuration
  error naming the variable: `^imagen-[a-z0-9]+(?:[.-][a-z0-9]+)*$` for the Imagen adapter,
  `^gemini-[a-z0-9]+(?:[.-][a-z0-9]+)*-image(-[a-z0-9]+(?:[.-][a-z0-9]+)*)?$` for the Gemini adapter,
  `^gpt-image-[a-z0-9]+(?:[.-][a-z0-9]+)*$` for the OpenAI branch.
- Three separate actions, do not mix them up:
  - **roll back the configuration**: restore exactly the values written down above and redeploy;
  - **return to the default**: delete the override variable and redeploy (this is not a rollback);
  - **roll back the code**: revert the squash commit and redeploy — that restores the retired
    `imagen-4.0-generate-001` default, so it does not promise a working generation path.
- Check the server log after the first manual generation: adapter error classes (`blocked-prompt`,
  `blocked`, `incomplete`, `no-image`, `unsupported-format`, `empty-image`, `invalid-png`, `too-large`)
  are visible in the server log and never in the HTTP response.
- Google has no transparent background, so emoji from the Google branch carry a white field; see the
  known limitations and the provider comparison in `docs/ai.md`.

### Env strategy (Vercel)

- Production (`master`):
  - Pooled `DATABASE_URL` for the production DB with `sslmode=verify-full`
  - `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` (strong secret). _Note: `NEXTAUTH_URL` is handled automatically by Vercel._
  - OAuth/email keys (`GOOGLE_*`, `RESEND_*`) as needed
  - `UPSTASH_REDIS_*` (recommended)
- Preview (`develop` and feature branches):
  - Separate preview DB (`DATABASE_URL`)
  - Never reuse the production database URL; leave database-backed preview routes disabled until a
    dedicated database or Neon branch is available
  - Separate OAuth app is recommended for preview
  - `UPSTASH_REDIS_*` can be shared or separate
- Development (local `.env`):
  - Local DB URL
  - Local auth secrets
  - Optional external providers

## Database

- Create and apply local migrations: `npx prisma migrate dev`
- Deploy migrations (prod): `npx prisma migrate deploy`
- Seed data: `npx prisma db seed`
- Backup DB (to `backups/*.dump`): `npm run db:backup`
- Restore DB (latest backup): `npm run db:restore`
- Restore DB (specific file): `npm run db:restore -- clickmoji-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.dump`
- Both run `pg_dump` / `pg_restore` in the `postgres:17-alpine` image: production is PostgreSQL 17.11
  and a `pg_dump` 16 client refuses a 17 server.
- Production backups must be encrypted, access-controlled, monitored, and restore-tested.
- Do not use ordinary GitHub Actions artifacts as the long-term production backup store.
- Before a production migration, create and verify a fresh backup, run `prisma migrate deploy` with
  a direct/unpooled database URL, and confirm `prisma migrate status` afterwards.

### Duplicate variant repair (AGE-1536 / AGE-1545)

Migration `20261102224241_drop_legacy_item_variant_unique` removes the legacy
`items_listId_productId_variantId_key` with `DROP INDEX IF EXISTS`. Existing shopping rows and
history are not deleted. Do not edit or mark the older migration as reapplied: an already recorded
migration does not repair a surviving index. The repair is safe when the index is already absent.

The ordinary (non-CONCURRENTLY) `DROP INDEX` requests **ACCESS EXCLUSIVE on `items`**: it can
block **SELECT/readers as well as writers** while held, and new requests can queue behind its
lock request. The migration sets `lock_timeout = '5s'` and `statement_timeout = '15s'` before DROP.
The first bounds each lock wait; the second bounds statement execution, not the entire deployment.
These are not a promise of zero interruption. Use a quiet window and stop on timeout.

Prisma execution was checked against the installed CLI 7.10.1 / schema engine
`d1b3f377ca835d73fd50954a5e22128b9ebdd6b8` on local PostgreSQL: a single-statement CONCURRENTLY
probe succeeds, and two writes in one migration file have different transaction IDs. This engine
executes statements without a file-wide transaction. We retain ordinary DROP, not CONCURRENTLY.
The timeout SETs belong only to the dedicated migration connection; RESET restores its default
policy on success (verified by a following migration). On failure the deploy command exits and
closes that connection. There is no global/server or application-pool timeout change. Explicit
BEGIN was not used: on this engine an aborted transaction masks the original lock error while
Prisma records the failure. The actual repair now returns PostgreSQL 55P03 on contention and
preserves the index; the isolated test exercises recovery as well as successful/idempotent runs.

Production rollout is operator-owned; local regression commands never deploy to production:

1. Create and verify a fresh production backup. Schedule the index drop when briefly blocking
   both reads and writes is acceptable; use the direct/unpooled URL without printing credentials.
2. From the reviewed release, run `npm run migrate:deploy`, then `npx prisma migrate status`.
3. Run `npm run db:check-item-indexes` against the same database. This command opens a read-only
   transaction, compares `public.items` indexes with the Item schema, and exits nonzero for an extra
   UNIQUE (even if renamed), missing indexes, or changed definitions. Full canonical
   `pg_get_indexdef` is compared, including key order, sort/null order, operator classes, collation,
   INCLUDE columns, method and predicates, in addition to unique/primary/valid flags. It never
   repairs drift.
4. Deploy the application containing nonblocking add feedback. In a test shopping list, add the
   same variant twice: both requests must succeed and both rows/badges must remain visible.
   Verify that an add error stays inline, preserves selection, and opens no native alert.

Stop rollout if migration or verification fails. Do not recreate the old UNIQUE on code rollback:
duplicate shopping rows are intentional and may already exist after rollout. Keep the compatible
schema repair; a data restore is a separate operator decision, not an automatic rollback step.

On lock timeout, do not loop deploy or kill application sessions blindly. Verify from a fresh
connection that the legacy index still exists and inspect `prisma migrate status` / the failed
migration receipt. Release the blocker normally or wait for a quieter window. Prisma records the
failed attempt and blocks later deploys: after verification, mark **only this failed attempt**
rolled back with `npx prisma migrate resolve --rolled-back 20261102224241_drop_legacy_item_variant_unique`,
then retry `npm run migrate:deploy` in that quiet window and repeat status/drift verification.
Do not mark it applied merely to bypass the failure. A code rollback remains compatible with the
removed index; restoring uniqueness is neither required nor safe after duplicate rows exist.

Local checks (after `npm ci`, with a local `.env`, never a production URL):

- `npm run test:items-postgres`: real item POST handler against `clickmoji-local-pg` on loopback:5432;
  randomly named fixtures only, no truncate/reset. Covers successive requests, one batch, and null
  variants. Run before/after the migration to observe the constraint regression.
- `npm run db:check-item-indexes`: expected indexes are `items_pkey` (unique id), `items_listId_idx`,
  and `items_productId_idx` (both nonunique).
- `npm run test:repair-postgres`: owns a fresh database inside `clickmoji-local-pg`, never the
  restored public schema. Runs Prisma transaction probes, holds a conflicting reader lock, checks
  timeout/index preservation, resolve/retry, reset policy, and repeats the exact SQL twice. Also
  creates partial/hash/DESC/null-order/opclass/collation/INCLUDE drift and runs the actual scanner.
  `-- --baseline` reads the exact old `aae343d` migration/scanner from Git for RED receipts;
  add `--drift-only` to exercise the old scanner separately. Scratch DB/files are removed in finally.
- `npm run test:e2e:variants`: opt-in local DB suite, isolated fixture users, production build/server
  on port 3136, Chromium and WebKit with 375px touch emulation. Successful adds use the real local
  API. Injected 500/403/network failures test inline feedback, preserved selection and successful
  retry. The native-dialog invariant is “no dialog at all”; the sampled former OK-area tap is not
  proof of OS-native dialog geometry or of the original physical-phone ghost click.

Add retry contract: category/favorites selection POSTs are atomic (validated batch, one database
transaction), so no per-item partial response is invented: a failed batch remains selected and is
retried as that whole failed operation. FavoritesSection's item-add and usage-counter update are
separate operations: after item success/usage failure, feedback explicitly says the item was added,
and the counter retry never sends another item POST. Deliberate duplicate adds remain available.
AI create/add similarly retains the created product for add-only retry. Cache/callback housekeeping
failure cannot relabel a committed write as an add failure. The separate text-import endpoint can
return a true added/failed report: partial results stay open and retry prepares only failed names
for user review, never the original successful entries. Its existing failed DTO lacks quantities/
notes, so the UI explicitly asks the shopper to review those before resubmitting.

## Scripts

- `npm run dev` (Start local server)
- `npm run check` (Typecheck + Lint + Test)
- `npm run lint`
- `npm run test` (Vitest single run)
- `npm run test:watch` (Vitest watch mode)
- `npm run test:e2e` (Playwright)

## PWA

- Service worker: `public/sw.js`
- Manifest: `public/manifest.json`
- Offline fallback: `public/offline.html`

### DB Scripts (domain)

Execute using `tsx`:

- Users: `npx tsx scripts/db-users.ts --help`
- Products: `npx tsx scripts/db-products.ts --help`
- Categories: `npx tsx scripts/db-categories.ts --help`
- Lists: `npx tsx scripts/db-lists.ts --help`
- Files: `npx tsx scripts/db-files.ts --help`
- Transfer: `npx tsx scripts/db-transfer.ts --help`

## Deploy

- Default target: Vercel
- Runtime baseline: Node.js 24 in Vercel, `.nvmrc`, package engines, and CI
- Ensure all environment variables are set per environment
- Run `prisma migrate deploy` before deploying application code that depends on a migration.
- Seed only new, empty environments; do not seed production automatically.

## Branching and release flow

- `master`: production-only branch (stable)
- `develop`: integration branch (auto-preview)
- `feature/*`: short-lived task branches from `develop`
- Open PRs into `develop`, test in Vercel Preview, then merge `develop` -> `master` for production release

## Security notes

- Passwords are hashed with bcrypt
- Admin access enforced by role checks
- API role checks centralized in `src/lib/auth-guards.ts` (use `requireAdmin`/`requireUser`)
- Keep secrets out of `NEXT_PUBLIC_*`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` is intentionally public and must contain only the canonical site URL.
- Production rate limiting should use Upstash rather than the per-process memory fallback.
